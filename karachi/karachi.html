    <h1 class="a2">KARACHI THE CITY OF QUAID</h1>
    <p style="color: beige;"> Karachi, city and capital of Sindh province, southern Pakistan. It is the country’s largest city and principal seaport and is a major commercial and industrial centre. Karachi is located on the coast of the Arabian Sea immediately northwest of the Indus River delta.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The city has been variously called Caranjee, Crochey, Krotchey, Currachee, and Kurrachee, all of which are believed to be variants of the same name. In the 18th century it was known as Kalachi-jo-Goth,meaning “the village of Kalachi” (Kalachi being the name of an erstwhile head of the settlement).</p>
    <br>
    <p> impetus to Karachi’s development originally came from its role as the port serving the Indus River valley and the Punjab region of British India. The development of air travel subsequently increased Karachi’s importance. It is also the port serving the landlocked country of Afghanistan. Area city, 228 square miles (591 square km); Greater Karachi, 560 square miles (1,450 square km). Pop. (2017) city, 14,916,456; (2018 est.) urban agglom., 15,400,000.</p>
